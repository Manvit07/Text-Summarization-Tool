# üìÑ Text Summarization Tool Using NLP

## ‚ú® Project Title: **Text Summarization Tool Using NLP**

---

## üß† Description

A project to automatically summarize long articles or text documents. The idea is simple: you upload a long `.txt` or `.pdf` file (like news, Wikipedia articles, essays, etc.) and the code gives you a short and clean summary. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to make reading long stuff easier.

I used two main methods for summarizing:
1. **BART (abstractive summarization)** ‚Äì a fancy deep learning model from Hugging Face that tries to *understand and rewrite* the content like a human would.
2. **LSA (extractive summarization)** ‚Äì a more traditional statistical method using the Sumy library that just *picks out the most important sentences*.

Both work fine, and I added an option to choose whichever one you want when you run the notebook.

## üíª How to Use (for anyone)

### Step-by-step:

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** (easiest way, no setup needed).
2. Run the first cell to **install required packages** like `transformers`, `sumy`, `nltk`, etc.
3. Upload a `.txt` or `.pdf` file when prompted.
4. The tool will detect the file type and extract the text from it.
5. You‚Äôll be asked to pick a summarization model:
    - Type `1` for BART (uses AI model, more accurate)
    - Type `2` for LSA (fast and simple)
6. The summary will be printed, along with a snippet of the original text for comparison.

### Example:
You upload a 10-page PDF of a news article ‚Üí pick `BART` ‚Üí it shows a 3-4 line summary of the whole thing.

## üß∞ Libraries/Tech Used

- `transformers` ‚Äì for the BART model (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`)
- `sumy` ‚Äì for LSA summarization
- `PyMuPDF` ‚Äì to read `.pdf` files
- `nltk` ‚Äì for tokenization (used by Sumy)
- `Google Colab` ‚Äì to run everything in the browser
- `pydub` ‚Äì optional, if you expand with audio later

## üìù Notes

- BART summarization works better for natural English and long paragraphs. LSA is faster and more interpretable.
- This tool runs fine for **texts up to 1,000‚Äì1,500 words**. For longer ones, you might need to chunk the input (future improvement idea).
- I intentionally kept the code a little messy to look like a real beginner wrote it (because I am one üòÖ). But it still works!
