# ðŸ“„ Text Summarization Tool Using NLP

## âœ¨ Project Title: **Text Summarization Tool Using NLP**

---

## ðŸ§  Description

A project to automatically summarize long articles or text documents. The idea is simple: you upload a long `.txt` or `.pdf` file (like news, Wikipedia articles, essays, etc.) and the code gives you a short and clean summary. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to make reading long stuff easier.

I used two main methods for summarizing:
1. **BART (abstractive summarization)** â€“ a fancy deep learning model from Hugging Face that tries to *understand and rewrite* the content like a human would.
2. **LSA (extractive summarization)** â€“ a more traditional statistical method using the Sumy library that just *picks out the most important sentences*.

Both work fine, and I added an option to choose whichever one you want when you run the notebook.

## ðŸ’» How to Use (for anyone)

### Step-by-step:

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** (easiest way, no setup needed).
2. Run the first cell to **install required packages** like `transformers`, `sumy`, `nltk`, etc.
3. Upload a `.txt` or `.pdf` file when prompted.
4. The tool will detect the file type and extract the text from it.
5. Youâ€™ll be asked to pick a summarization model:
    - Type `1` for BART (uses AI model, more accurate)
    - Type `2` for LSA (fast and simple)
6. The summary will be printed, along with a snippet of the original text for comparison.

### Example:
You upload a 10-page PDF of a news article â†’ pick `BART` â†’ it shows a 3-4 line summary of the whole thing.

## ðŸ§° Libraries/Tech Used

- `transformers` â€“ for the BART model (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`)
- `sumy` â€“ for LSA summarization
- `PyMuPDF` â€“ to read `.pdf` files
- `nltk` â€“ for tokenization (used by Sumy)
- `Google Colab` â€“ to run everything in the browser
